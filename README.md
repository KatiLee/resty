# Lab 26: Phase 1 RESTy
In this phase, we aim to set up the basic scaffolding of the application to build upon in the subsequent phases. The initial build establishes a scalable file structure for the project.

### Technical Requirements / Notes

The application, as initially developed, was done using class components. In order to go to production, we need to convert it to an application written using React function components for better stability and performance.

**No Testing Required for Phase 1**
