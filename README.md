# Lab 26: Phase 1 RESTy
In this phase, we aim to set up the basic scaffolding of the application to build upon in the subsequent phases. The initial build establishes a scalable file structure for the project.

### Technical Requirements / Notes

The application, as initially developed, was done using class components. In order to go to production, we need to convert it to an application written using React function components for better stability and performance.

**No Testing Required for Phase 1**

# Lab 27: Phase 2 RESTy

In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components. In order to properly manage state with the useState hook, we will now convert <App /> to a functional component.

### Technical Requirements / Notes

Extend your React Application so that your functional components are able to manage their own state variables using the useState() Hook.

# Lab 29: Phase 4 RESTy

In phase 4, we will be tracking every API call and storing it in history.

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.
### Technical Requirements / Notes

Refactor your state management within the App component to use the useReducer() hook.

Replace any component state managements to use derived state from useReducer() with a reducer function and initial state.
